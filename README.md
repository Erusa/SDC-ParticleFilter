#Particle Filter

My own Project from SDC Udacity Course (Project 6). This code implements a Particle Filter, which uses probability, initial GPS position and sensed landmarks to get the exact position of a car, given a known map.

1. src/particle.cpp --> main functions of the Particle Filter implemented
2. src/debugger_functions.cpp, scr/multiv_gauss.cpp --> additional functions for Particle Filter
